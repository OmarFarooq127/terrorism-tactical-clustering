# Exploratory Analysis & Behavioral Clustering on Global Terrorism Dataset  

**Data Analytics Project**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis and behavioral clustering** of terrorist incidents using the Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD). The goal was to explore **patterns in attack behavior, targeting trends, and operational similarities** across different terrorist groups.

This repository contains **my individual contribution** within a larger group-based data visualization semester project.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on large-scale real-world terrorism data  
- Analyze **behavioral patterns in attacks and targets**  
- Experiment with **unsupervised clustering techniques**  
- Build **visualizations** to interpret behavioral groupings  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)  
- **Size:** 180,000+ incident records
- **Link:** https://www.start.umd.edu/data-tools/GTD

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated global and regional attack trends  
- Analyzed distributions of attack types, targets, and weapons  
- Explored correlations among behavioral attributes  

### 2. Clustering Experiments
- Tested unsupervised learning approaches to group incidents based on behavioral similarity  
- Experimented with **K-Means clustering**, but results were not sufficiently meaningful for final analysis  
- Refined approach using **hierarchical clustering** based on attack and target similarity

### 3. Visualization
- Built **radial cluster visualizations** to represent behavioral groupings  
- Designed analytical plots to support interpretation and comparison of observed patterns

## 📈 Key Observations

- Identified dominant **attack and targeting trends** across regions  
- Observed **behavioral similarities among geographically distant incidents**  
- Highlighted consistent operational patterns across multiple terrorist organizations
